<a id="quick-key-privacy-policy" class="anchor" href="#quick-key-privacy-policy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick Key Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>This Policy applies to all facets of our service accessed via any type of electronic device. By utilizing our service, you agree to the capture, retention, dissemination and use of your data and information by the following terms. Any protections, conditions, terms, agreements, and restrictions in this Privacy Policy are considered applicable to DBE, Inc and the Quick Key Mobile Service.</p>

<h4>
<a id="1-security" class="anchor" href="#1-security" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Security</h4>

<p>We highly value the security of your information. Whenever you input financial and/or sensitive information (such as credit card information) on our transactional forms, we use secure socket layer (SSL) to encrypt the information being transmitted. As another means of protecting the information we receive from you, we follow generally accepted standards, both during transmission and after it is received. As no method is 100% secure, we cannot promise or guarantee absolute security of electronic submission or storage. Please direct any security questions or concerns you may have to our customer support. You are responsible for safeguarding the password you use to access this service and you agree not to disclose the password to any third party. You are responsible for any activity using your account, whether or not you authorize that activity. You should immediately notify customer support of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

<a id="2-information-and-data" class="anchor" href="#2-information-and-data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. Information and Data</h4>

<p>Please note that we may collect and store the following information when you access the Quick Key Mobile Services: Data, Files and Images We collect and store the data and/or files you enter, upload, download, capture, scan or access with the Quick Key Mobile Services. Log Data We automatically record necessary and/or relevant information from your Device, its software, and your activity when you use the Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, your mobile carrier, locale preferences, metadata related to your files and images, the web page visited before you came to our website, browser type, information you search for on our website, identification numbers associated with your Devices, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, and other interactions with the Services. Cookies All or part of the Quick Key Mobile Services use cookies for user identification. Cookies must be enabled on your browser for use of our Services. Account Information When an account is created, Quick Key collects personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. In the course of using the Services, we may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve the Services, (ii) to administer your use of the Services, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If, at any points, you wish to no longer receive communications from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings as they relate to such communications. Geo-Location Information Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our mobile apps do not collect such information as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services. Please note that images you upload or share with Quick Key Mobile may contain recorded location information and we may use this information to optimize your experience. Also, IP address information from a particular device can sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s location. Analytics Quick Key Mobile or our associated third party services may also collect additional information by means of logging and cookies (which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information). This information is used to administer, monitor, enhance, and analyze use of the Services as well as to verify users have the authorization needed for the Services to process their requests.</p>

<a id="3-sharingrelease-of-information" class="anchor" href="#3-sharingrelease-of-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. Sharing/Release of Information</h4>

<p>Partners and Service Providers Certain third party companies and individuals that we trust may be used to help us support and/or improve the Services (including but not limited to hosting, data storage, maintenance services, analytics, payment processing, database management, and improvement of features). These outside parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. Third-Party Applications With your consent, we may share your information with a third party application, such as when you choose to access the Services through such an application. Quick Key Mobile is not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you. Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Quick Key Mobile’s Rights We may disclose data or information associated with or collected from your Quick Key Mobile account and/or any of your devices that have interacted with the Services when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to perform any combination of the following: (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Quick Key Mobile or its users; (d) to protect Quick Key Mobile’s property rights. If we provide your Quick Key Mobile files to a law enforcement agency as described above, files will be unencrypted prior to being provided to said law enforcement. Transfer of Ownership In the event that Quick Key Mobile participates in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. You will be notified (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. You will also be notified of choices you may have regarding the information. Non-private or Non-Personal Information Your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information may be shared with other parties (such as usage statistics of the Services).</p>
